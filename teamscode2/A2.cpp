 * DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS
 * DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE
 * CHECK INT VS LONG, IF YOU NEED TO STORE LARGE NUMBERS
 * CHECK CONSTRAINTS, C <= N <= F...
 * CHECK SPECIAL CASES, N = 1...
 * CHECK ARRAY BOUNDS, HOW BIG ARRAY HAS TO BE
 * TO TEST TLE/MLE, PLUG IN MAX VALS ALLOWED AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
 * ALSO CALCULATE BIG-O, OVERALL TIME COMPLEXITY
 * compile with "g++ -std=c++11 filename.cpp" if using auto keyword
