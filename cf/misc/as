    I am an open-minded person who is a lifelong student, as I relish in learning about anything new and foreign, which adds to my knowledge as a person and employee. I have experience in programming, with a focus on file parsing and data scraping. With file-parsing, I am able to gather data and statistics, which enable companies to better understand and categorize their datasheets. During my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and watching Chinese dramas.
